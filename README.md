## Project Overview

### Project Name
Undecided.ly

### Project Description
I built Undecided.ly one weekend to practice my skills with React, which  this app uses as well as accessing RESTFUL APIs.  The basic idea is an app for people who have trouble making decisions for what they want to eat.  This is, in essence, a random recipe generator. 

In future iterations, it would be nice to add some limiting contraints to results such as vegan and dish-origin options.

** This app is not currently deployed.
